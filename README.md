# Cottage-model-in-html-using-Threejs

3D model has been rendered from my another github repository. 
.obj, .mtl and texture files are generated from Vectary. The ObjLoader and MtlLoader has been implemented from an open source github repository.
Index html file defines the directories of required files and sets up canvas for 3D model. Main js loads the necessary functionalities such as scene, camera, geometry .etc and also loads the obj and corresponding materials and textures. It can be run locally from express server.
The output is a web page with an interactive 3D model of a cottage.
